# Title: Launch impactMarket Community Ambassador Program

## Short description: This proposal aims to launch a Community Ambassador Program for impactMarket, which will help increase the awareness of the platform and its mission, foster engagement with the community, and bring in new users.

## Scope description:

### Background:

ImpactMarket is a decentralized platform that aims to provide Universal Basic Income (UBI) to individuals and communities in need, as well as connecting donors with those in need. In order to achieve its goals, impactMarket actively interacts with its communities on the ground in various ways.

One way that impactMarket interacts with its communities is through its "Learn & Earn" program. This program incentivizes community members to learn about impactMarket and cryptocurrency by completing educational courses and quizzes, and in turn, earn PACT tokens. This program not only provides a way for community members to earn income, but also promotes education and adoption of cryptocurrency in the communities.

Another way that impactMarket interacts with its communities is through its micro-lending service. This service provides small loans to individuals and groups in need, with the requirement that the loans be repaid in PACT tokens. This creates a way for community members to access capital, while also promoting the use and adoption of PACT as a means of exchange.

Furthermore, impactMarket also interacts with its communities through its ambassador program. The ambassador program encourages community members to spread awareness about impactMarket and recruit new users in exchange for PACT tokens. This program not only promotes the adoption of impactMarket and PACT, but also provides a way for community members to earn income by sharing information with others.

In addition to these programs, impactMarket also interacts with its communities by regularly communicating with them through social media, community forums, and other channels. This allows community members to provide feedback, ask questions, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments and initiatives of impactMarket.

There are several social and economic driving factors that can influence the behavior of the different categories of people involved in the impactMarket ecosystem.

For Donors, one driving factor could be their desire to make a positive impact in impoverished communities. Many donors may be driven by altruistic motives and a desire to help those in need. In addition, donors may also be motivated by the rewards they receive in the form of PACT tokens. These rewards provide an additional incentive for donors to contribute to impactMarket and can encourage them to donate more frequently or in larger amounts.

For UBI Communities, the driving factors may vary depending on the specific community and their needs. However, some common factors may include the desire to improve their standard of living, access education or job training, and gain financial stability. By participating in impactMarket's programs and activities, UBI communities may have the opportunity to access resources and services that can help them achieve these goals.

For Investors, the driving factors may be more financially focused. Investors may be looking for opportunities to make a profit by investing in PACT tokens. They may also be interested in the potential long-term value of the token and how it may appreciate in value over time. Additionally, some investors may be motivated by the social impact of their investment, and may be attracted to impactMarket's mission of supporting impoverished communities.

The social and economic driving factors for each category of people involved in impactMarket are complex and multifaceted. Understanding these driving factors can be important for developing effective strategies to incentivize engagement and maximize the impact of the impactMarket ecosystem.

It is important to note that impactMarket is using Commonwealth as a governance platform, and therefore proposals need to follow a specific structure in order to be considered and voted on by the DAO. Looking at past proposals can give insight into the types of activities impactMarket is engaging in, as well as the level of detail and structure required for a successful proposal.

When reflecting on the social and economic driving factors for the various categories of people involved with PACT, it is important to consider how these factors may inform the content and structure of a proposal. For example, a proposal that incentivizes UBI communities to use their PACT in a way that directly impacts their lives may resonate more strongly with this group, while a proposal that emphasizes the potential for increased token value may appeal more to investors.

In terms of the structure of a proposal, it is essential to include all necessary information and follow any specific guidelines provided by the governance platform. This may include outlining the problem being addressed, providing details on the proposed solution, specifying the resources required, and outlining the expected outcomes and impact. Following a clear and organized structure can help ensure that the proposal is easily understood by the community and has a better chance of being approved.

Overall, impactMarket actively interacts with its communities on the ground through a variety of programs and communication channels. These efforts not only promote the adoption and use of PACT, but also provide ways for community members to earn income and access capital, ultimately contributing to the platform's goal of providing Universal Basic Income to those in need.
As impactMarket grows, it becomes increasingly important to have an engaged and active community that can help promote the platform and its mission. A Community Ambassador Program can help achieve this by creating a network of advocates who can reach out to potential users, share information about impactMarket, and help answer questions about the platform.
